# AD7747_Height_sensor
Capacitance height sensor
The main problem in Oxy Flame Cutting Machine is its torch height control. This can be overcome by setting capacitance precisely. 
             In this project I used AD7747 which is capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC) integrated chip designed for single ended or differential capacitive sensors with one plate connected to ground.
